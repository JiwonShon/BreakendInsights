## README Draft ðŸ“„  

This Nextflow script is based on the workflow from [`namzoo99/aa_bp_seq_seek`](https://github.com/namzoo99/aa_bp_seq_seek) and has been updated to support **tm-nm pair mode**.

Additionally, the final process includes `post_aabpss`, which introduces a post-processing step to generate an **analysis-ready file** based on `somatic.sv.vcf.bedpe`.
